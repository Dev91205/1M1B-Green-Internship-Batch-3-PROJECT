# 🏡 Carbon Footprint Calculator for Households

[Live Demo 🚀](https://sayakaono.github.io/footprint-calculator/)

This project is a web-based **Carbon Footprint Calculator** that helps households estimate their environmental impact based on daily lifestyle choices. It empowers individuals and families with insights and actionable suggestions to reduce their carbon emissions and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle.

## 🌱 Why This Project?

As the climate crisis intensifies, households play a crucial role in shaping a greener future. However, many people are unaware of the carbon impact of their day-to-day actions—be it commuting, energy usage, or food habits. This tool fills that gap by offering a simple, interactive platform to calculate, understand, and reduce one's carbon footprint.

- 📊 **Visual Insights**: Graphs and charts (via Chart.js) provide a clear view of carbon contributors.
- 💡 **Eco-Friendly Tips**: Personalized suggestions help users take meaningful steps to reduce their impact.
- 🌎 **Responsive UI**: Fully mobile-friendly design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚧 How It Works

1. Visit the [Live Calculator](https://sayakaono.github.io/footprint-calculator/).
2. Enter your household details like:
   - Number of people
   - Monthly electricity usage
   - Commute preferences
   - Meat vs plant-based consumption
3. View a breakdown of your estimated monthly CO₂ emissions.
4. Get suggestions tailored to your input to reduce impact.

The calculation is based on widely accepted emissions factors and averages. It’s not meant for scientific precision but serves as a powerful awareness and action-driving tool.
